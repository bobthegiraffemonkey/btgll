# BTGLL

This is mostly based on Kirjava's idea from years ago that sadly never came to much. The idea was that instead of solving LL in two algs with a well-defined intermediate goal (e.g. OLL + PLL), try to pick a nice set of algs and solve using two of those (e.g. one case might be solved using T-perm + FRU'R'U'F').

I want to play around with it to see if I can get something practical out of it, first for 3x3 LL, then other stuff like megaminx LL, maybe LSLL? Also get some Rust experience.

See Kir's repo for context (caution: contains javascript): https://github.com/kirjavascript/2LL.
